# The Fisherman's Fractal

Here is a fishing boat in the ocean. There is a large fish strapped to the side.

`[Figure 1: Basic Ship]`

When the waves are too big they capsize the ship

`[Figure 2: Big waves ship]`

When the waves are small but have the right frequency they push the ship farther and farther until it capsizes.

`[Figure 3: Resonant frequency ship]`

This seems to be a very simple system. Our guess is that waves which closely match the ship's natural frequency will capsize the ship very easily. Otherwise large waves will capsize the ship regardless of frequency. Here is a sketch of our prediction:

`[Figure 4: Capsize graph sketch]`

The shaded region is the region of capsize.

However, the equations which describe the motion of the ship cannot be used to find this frequency directly. They are non-linear:

`[Figure 4: Equations of motion]`


We will try to find the natural frequency by running some simulations. Here are 25 ship simulations. Each ship starts at rest and is rocked by waves of different amplitudes and frequencies.

`[Figure 5]`

Based on these simulations we see 3 things:

1. Waves with large amplitudes tend to capsize the ship
1. The ship seems to respond to one frequency more than others
1. Something funny has happened in the 4th column

What happened in the 4th column? The 1st and 3rd ships from the top capsized but the
